## Books Recommendation System

This project is a web application that allows users to browse and search for books, and get personalized recommendations based on their preferences. The project is built using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It uses a dataset of over 10,000 books from Goodreads, which includes information such as title, author, genre, rating, and number of reviews.
Features

### The project has two main features:

**Home page:** This page displays the top 50 books in the dataset, ranked by their average rating. Users can click on any book to see more details, such as the book description, genre, and reviews. Users can also use the search bar to find books by title, author, or genre.

**Recommendation page:** This page allows users to get personalized book recommendations based on their input. Users can enter the name of a book they like, and the application will return four books that are similar to it, based on the ratings and genres of other users who liked the same book. Users can also click on the recommended books to see more details.
